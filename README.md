# juke
torrent music streaming app

*At the moment, juke is in its infancy. The current code is not optimized yet, but will gradually become so as I get time to update, or others contribute to cleaning up the code.*

juke searches various torrenting websites and scrapes the results, providing the details of the music torrent along with its metadata. The user can then stream and download the music through an itunes/spotify-like interface.

This was made for demo purposes only. Please support artists and the music industry.
